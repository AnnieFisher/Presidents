# Presidents

This project presents the 44 Presidents of the U.S. with image representation and some information about them. 

The AWS addresses:
http://52.10.144.122:8080/presidents/Presidents
http://www.nicklang.io:8080/Presidents/

There is an index page to enter the site. Once entered into the site, the user inputs a term number which returns the president
and that presidents information. From there the user can use "back" and "next" buttons to move through the sequential terms.
Sessions are used to store the information in order for the program to know what president the user is on and to corretly display
the next term in the sequence.

This project was created in week 6 with knowledge of Java, HTML/CSS, active web sessions.
